These scripts are for playing back an existing set of images and MAVLink tlog.

There are 3 scripts:
ImageLog.sh - for putting out the image and telemetry stream
PlayUAV.sh - the cuav_air module running in MAVProxy on a UAV
PlayGround.sh - the cuav_ground module running in MAVProxy in a GCS

The MAVProxy instance in PlayGround should be where the user manages
the images and processing.
