Welcome to the CanberraUAV Image Processing (cuav) Documentation!
=================================================================

The CanberraUAV Image Processing (cuav) software is designed to quickly and
accurately locate objects of interest from a large set of photos. With the addition
of flight logs of geo-tagging, it can also give the location of the objects.

It can be run in realtime directly from a camera, or offine from a folder of images.

Cuav was created by CanberraUAV as part of the UAV Challenge, in order to find a missing
bushwalker from photos taken by a Unmanned Aerial System (UAS, commonly known as a "drone")
as it flew over the search area at low altitude.

This software is commonly used by UAS that are seach for unusual objects (such as people or
livestock) on the ground.
